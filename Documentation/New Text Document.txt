An AI agent for Authenticity Documents Validator for Academia
Introduction
In the academic community, documents such as marksheets, degree certificates, and provisional certificates play a crucial role in activities such as admissions, employment verification, scholarships, and further studies. With the growing digitization of academic documents, these documents are now being widely distributed in digital format. Although this has made it easier to access the documents, it has also resulted in an increase in cases of document forgery and manipulation. The ease of availability of sophisticated image editing software has made it easier to forge or manipulate certificates, raising serious concerns for academic institutions and employers.
Currently, most academic document verification tasks are done manually. These processes are time-consuming, require considerable human effort, and are also error-prone. Moreover, manual verification becomes a challenge when a large number of documents have to be verified. To overcome these problems, the proposed project introduces an AI agent-based Academic Document Authenticity Validation System. The system employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR), artificial intelligence algorithms, and secure data handling techniques to automatically verify academic documents and deliver correct and interpretable verification outputs.

Rationale
The reason for choosing this project is due to the rising need for a secure and automated system for the verification of academic documents. In recent years, there has been a growing number of cases involving forged academic documents, fake marksheets, and manipulated academic documents, which have created serious issues for academic institutions and organizations. The use of manual verification processes makes the entire process time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not suitable for processing large numbers of documents efficiently.
In addition, most of the current systems available are mainly designed for storing documents or providing basic security features, but they are not equipped with intelligent verification and decision-making capabilities. Another significant drawback of the current systems is the lack of clear and interpretable verification results, which makes it difficult for academic institutions to understand why a particular document has been accepted or rejected. Hence, there is a growing need for an academic institution to have a secure, automated, and reliable verification system.

Step 2: Secure Validation & Storage
•	Uploaded documents are validated for correct format and size, transmitted securely over HTTPS, and stored in encrypted form.
Step 3: OCR-Based Text Extraction

1.	Primary OCR (Tesseract OCR)
2.	Fallback OCR using AI algorithms for low-accuracy images
Step 4: Data Preprocessing & Structuring
•	Extracted text is pre-processed and structured to identify relevant fields such as student name, roll number, institution, year, and marks.
Step 5: Verification & Analysis
•	Rule-based validation of document structure and presence of mandatory fields
•	Anomaly and forgery detection using AI/ML algorithms
•	Cross-validation with academic records database
Step 6: Decision Engine
•	The AI agent marks the document as Verified, Suspicious, or Fake with a confidence level.
Step 7: Report Generation

3. Project Overview / Background:

Introduction
In the academic domain, documents such as marksheets, degree certificates, transcripts, and provisional certificates are critical for student admissions, employment verification, scholarships, and higher education applications. With the rapid digitization of academic records, the risk of document forgery and manipulation has also increased. Advanced image editing tools make it easier to alter academic documents, leading to serious issues such as fake degrees, modified marksheets, and impersonation.
Traditional academic document verification is largely manual, time-consuming, and dependent on human judgment, which makes it inefficient and prone to errors. To address these challenges, this project proposes an AI agent-based system for authenticity validation of academic documents. The system leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR), artificial intelligence techniques, and secure data handling mechanisms to automatically verify documents and provide reliable, explainable verification results.

Need of Work / Reason for Selection of this Project
The need for this project arises due to the following reasons:
•	Increasing cases of fake academic certificates and forged marksheets.
•	Manual verification processes are slow, labor-intensive, and not scalable.
•	Existing systems focus mainly on storage or security but lack intelligent decision-making.
•	Most verification systems do not provide explainable reasons for rejection or approval.
•	Academic institutions require a secure and automated solution to validate documents efficiently.
This project is selected to provide a smart, automated, and secure academic document verification system using AI agents, which can significantly reduce verification time and improve trust in digital academic credentials.
Problem Statement
To design and implement an AI agent-based system that automatically verifies the authenticity of academic documents by extracting key information, detecting forgery or inconsistencies, and generating an explainable verification report.

Objective
•	To develop an AI agent-based system for automated authenticity verification of academic documents.
•	To extract and structure textual information from academic documents using OCR techniques.
•	To validate academic documents using AI-based and rule-based verification methods.
•	To detect forged or tampered documents through anomaly detection and consistency checks.
•	To ensure secure handling of academic documents and generate explainable verification reports.


Block Diagram Explanation: AI-Based Academic Document Validation System
1.	User / Institution (Web Dashboard)
The system is accessed by users or institutions through a web-based dashboard. This interface allows authorized users to upload academic documents such as marksheets, certificates, and transcripts.
2.	Web Dashboard (Document Upload)
The web dashboard provides a simple interface for selecting and uploading academic documents. The system captures the uploaded file and initiates the validation process.
3.	Secure Upload & Validation
The uploaded document is checked for valid file type, file size, and secure transmission using HTTPS. This ensures that only supported and safe files are accepted by the system.
4.	Encrypted Document Storage
After validation, the uploaded document is stored securely in encrypted form. This protects sensitive academic data from unauthorized access.
5.	Hybrid OCR Layer
The system uses a hybrid OCR approach for text extraction:
o	Primary OCR (Tesseract OCR): Extracts text from scanned documents.
o	Fallback OCR (AI-Based OCR / API): Used if primary OCR fails or gives low accuracy.
This improves overall text extraction reliability.
6.	Extracted Text
The raw text obtained from OCR is collected and passed to the next stage for further processing and validation.
7.	Data Preprocessing and Structuring
The extracted text is cleaned and structured to identify key academic fields such as student name, university name, year, roll number, and marks.
8.	Academic Records Database
The structured data is compared with reference academic records (dummy or university-provided data). This enables cross-verification of extracted information.
9.	AI Agent / Core Decision Engine
This is the main intelligence module of the system. It performs:
o	Rule-based validation (format and mandatory fields)
o	AI/ML-based anomaly detection
o	Academic structure consistency checks
o	Comparison of extracted data with reference records
It also generates a confidence score for validation.
10.	Verification Decision
Based on analysis, the system classifies the document as:
o	Verified
o	Suspicious
o	Fake
11.	Security Layer
A security layer is applied to the results, including hash generation and access control. This ensures result integrity and prevents tampering.
12.	Verification Report Generator
The system generates a detailed verification report containing:
o	Final status (Verified/Suspicious/Fake)
o	Confidence score
o	Explanation of validation results
13.	Result Display and Report Download
The final verification result is displayed on the dashboard. Users can also download the verification report for official or institutional use.
